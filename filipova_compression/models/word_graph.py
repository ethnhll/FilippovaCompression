# General Algorithm
# 1) Add a start node, followed by a linear path of the words in 
# the first sentence as nodes, and an end node
# 2) For each word in additional sentences:
#      a) If stopword, include it only if there is some overlapping
#		  in non-stopword neighbors 
#      b) If (word, tag) node exists in graph and no part of that
#         sentence has already been mapped to node, add 1 to weight 
#         of edge and add the sentence id to the nodeâ€™s list of seen sentences
#      c) If word node does not exist, create a new a new node for it and an 
#         edge with weight 1 from the previous node and add the sentence id to 
#         its seen sentences list
