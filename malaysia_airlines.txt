The search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be expanded by another 60,000 square km in the Indian Ocean if the jetliner is not found by May, officials said Thursday, affirming their commitment to not give up until it is located.
Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said that Malaysia, Australia and China, which are leading the hunt for the Boeing 777 that went missing on March 8 last year, are “committed to the search.”
“If the aircraft is not found within the 60,000 square km, we have collectively decided to extend the search to another 60,000 square km within the highest probability area,” he said. However, searchers are hopeful that they can find the plane in the current search area, he said.
The announcement removes some ambiguity about the future of the search as it was never made clear what would happen if the plane is not found. It will also come as a solace to the relatives of the victims, who are holding out the hope of recovering the bodies.
Liow said the two areas together would cover 95 percent of the flight path of the plane, which went missing while on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. Most of the passengers were Chinese. It dropped off the radar, and investigators using satellite data later figured out that it made a series of turns and headed in a completely opposite direction from where it was going before crashing into the Indian Ocean.
“We are confident we are searching in the right area,” Australian Deputy Prime Minister and transport minister Warren Truss said at the news conference, alongside Liow. “We are confident we have the best search equipment ... if the plane is in the area we will find it.”
“Australia and Malaysia have been sharing the cost and we will continue to do that,” he said. “We are confident we will be able to fund whatever is necessary.”
In the first phase, a total of 120 million Australian dollars ($93.6 million) was spent by the two countries, split equally, and Liow said the next phase is estimated to cost A$50 million ($39 million).
The lower cost is because the equipment has already been purchased.
The two ministers said they expect the second phase to take the rest of this year. But it is likely to be hindered by bad weather as winter sets in soon in the southern hemisphere, where seasons are opposite that of the northern hemisphere.
A statement issued after the meeting said the ministers also agreed on plans for recovery activities, including securing evidence, in the event the aircraft is found, but gave no details.
In late January this year, Malaysia’s government formally declared the plane’s disappearance an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead. A comprehensive report into the disappearance found no significant anomalies in the flight, except that the battery of the locator beacon for the plane’s data recorder had expired more than a year before the jet vanished.
That still does not explain what caused the plane to veer so off course in what has become aviation’s biggest mystery that continues to confound experts and investigators alike. At the same time, the relatives of the dead have got no closure and many still believe that their loved ones may be alive amid a host of conspiracy theories including one that the plane was hijacked and landed somewhere safely.
One theory also has the plane flying west to Maldives. Truss said the plane may have had enough fuel to reach Maldives but it would have been impossible for it to be in the reported area in daylight and not be seen by anyone. Also, the flight path to Maldives would be inconsistent with satellite and radar data. “It is not considered a likely possibility,” he said.
China’s transport minister Yang Chuantang said China may contribute vessels and other assets in the next search phase.
“We will marshal some physical assets including vessels to participate in the search,” he said. “We will not waver in our commitment to continue the search until we find the plane and resolve the mystery.”
Officials from Malaysia, Australia and China said Thursday that they would double the search area for the Malaysia Airlines jet that disappeared more than a year ago if it is not found by the end of next month. Vessels that have scoured the southern Indian Ocean far off the coast of Australia for months have found no trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people aboard. “We are moving to widen out the search area and to extend it in every direction,” Warren Truss, Australia’s deputy prime minister, said after a meeting here with Liow Tiong Lai and Yang Chuantang, the Malaysian and Chinese transportation ministers. An area of about 23,100 square miles has been deemed the plane’s most likely resting place, based on technical data transmitted during the flight by an onboard aircraft maintenance system. About 60 percent of that area has been searched, according to the Australian agency coordinating the deep­sea search; the agency said it expected the search of the remaining 40 percent to be largely completed by next month. The search will be expanded to about 46,000 square miles if Flight 370 is not found by the end of May, and the expanded search could last “at least the rest of this year,” Mr. Truss said. Officials said the cost of expanding the search would be around $35 million, which would be shared by Australia and Malaysia. The two governments together have already committed around $86 million for the search. The Boeing 777 dropped off radar screens during a routine red­eye flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital, to Beijing. Based on data from military radar and the plane’s electronic communications with a satellite, the authorities say it inexplicably changed course, flying west over the Malaysian Peninsula and eventually south to the Indian Ocean. All 239 of the passengers and crew members who were on the plane, most of them Chinese, are presumed dead. Four ships are under contract by the Australian and Malaysian governments to search for wreckage from the plane, but bad weather has at times bought the search to a standstill, with sea swells reaching up to 55 feet as cyclones churned through the ocean. Fugro Survey, a division of a Dutch company hired by the Australian government to look for the wreckage, has three vessels at sea, some of which tow side­scan sonar devices that glide above the ocean floor at the end of fiberoptic cables up to 10,000 yards long. The search area covers an area where the ocean floor has never been fully mapped. Mr. Truss said search crews were mapping extinct volcanoes and other previously unknown geological formations. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in Australia’s Parliament last month, “I can’t promise that the search will go on at this intensity forever, but we will continue our very best efforts to resolve this mystery and find some answers.” Thomas Fuller reported from Kuala Lumpur and Michelle Innis from Sydney, Australia.

Malaysia, Australia and China agreed Thursday to double the size of the search area for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 if the missing plane isn’t found by the end of May. Authorities have combed about 60% of the 60,000-square-kilometer (23,000-square-mile) search area in the southern Indian Ocean for the Boeing 777. The plane was carrying 239 passengers and crew when it became an aviation tragedy and mystery by vanishing during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Most of the passengers were Chinese citizens.
The area covered by the search, which is currently being led by Australia, will be expanded by another 60,000 square kilometers if the plane isn’t found by the end of next month, Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said at a joint news conference after a meeting of transport ministers of the three countries involved.
No trace of the aircraft has been found. Authorities relied on digital information transmitted from the plane to a satellite hours after it dropped off radar. Mining that trail of data led investigators to identify an area far off the southwestern coast of Australia as the likely crash site.
Family members of those aboard the flight expressed relief that authorities remain committed to finding the plane.
“I am so grateful the search will not stop,” Elaine Chew, wife of steward Tan Size Hiang, told The Wall Street Journal.
Still, the lack of progress has generated doubt and frustration. Selamat Omar, whose only son, Mohamad Khairul Amri, was aboard the ill-fated flight, said he finds it “strange” that not a single object has been found, given that the plane supposedly crashed into these waters.
“This search has been a waste of time,” he added.
Authorities declared their continued confidence that the aircraft will eventually be found within identified search area.
The next phase of the search, if necessary, could take up to a year because of adverse weather, Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Warren Truss said. Mr. Liow estimates it could cost 50 million Australian dollars (US$38.7 million). The current phase, set to for completion by the end of May, will cost 120 million Australian dollars, with Australia and Malaysia providing the funding.
China may send physical assets, including ships, to help with the next phase, China Transport Minister Yang Chuantang said.
A search of the additional 60,000 square kilometers would mean that “all high probability search areas would have been covered,” the three nations said in a joint statement.
The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in the Indian Ocean could be doubled, if the wreckage isn’t found by May.
The search area could expand to 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 miles) and the extra territory could take up another year of exploring the waters for more evidence.
So far, search teams have combed through a sea-floor larger than the Netherlands in a distant region of the south Indian Ocean, which is about a third of the way from Madagascar to Australia.
On January 29th Malaysia’s civil aviation department determined that Flight 370 was an accident and declared that all passengers on board were presumed dead.
The affirmation was a motive to help families collect assistance including compensation.
It's been more than a year since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH 370 was lost with 239 people on board. Officials now say they'll double the already huge search area in the southern Indian Ocean to 46,000 square miles if the plane isn't found by next month.
International search teams have used aircraft and underwater scans to look for the Boeing 777 since it disappeared from flight trackers in March of 2014. A report that was released last month says the locator beacon on the plane's "black box" flight recorder had a battery that was more than a year out of date.
Despite several false alarms and a wealth of theories, no trace of the plane has been found. For perspective, the current search area of 23,000 square miles is nearly the size of the state of West Virginia. The new search area would be more like the size of Pennsylvania.
From Beijing, NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports:
"Representatives of the Malaysian, Chinese and Australian governments are meeting in Kuala Lumpur. They sent a letter to family members of those aboard the plane. It says that if the current search comes up empty, they'll double the search area to about 46,000 square miles.
"The news was welcomed by next-of-kin, some of whom worry that searchers will just give up if they don't find anything."
Officials say they've looked at around 60 percent of the current search area, according to The Wall Street Journal. The search group has committed to looking for the missing airliner for at least one more year.

Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said that Malaysia, Australia and China, which are leading the hunt for the Boeing 777 that went missing on March 8 last year, are "committed to the search."
He told reporters after meeting with his counterparts from the other two countries that so far 61 percent of the 60,000 kilometer (23,000-square-mile) search area has been scoured off Australia's west coast. The remaining 39 percent would have been searched by the end of May, he said.

KUALA LUMPUR: The MH370 Family Support Group, Voice370 has called upon several groups to support and fund the search  of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

Voice 370 in a media statement on Wednesday said that the appeal was made to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United Nations (UN), Aviation Industry Regulators,Commercial entities in the Aviation Industry, including Boeing and Airbus Aviation Industry Organisations and the three countries involved -  Malaysia, China and Australia. 

This appeal is to enable investigation team to determine what happened to the flight, and in the interest of aviation safety ,support the development of remedial measures to prevent a recurrence of another similar tragedy.

They also believe it will only then bring about a closure to the suffering experienced by families , relatives and friends of those onboard flight MH370.

Flight MH370 dropped off the radar on March 8 last year as it flew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew on board.

The Boeing 777 aircraft has yet to be found, even after an exhaustive search in the southern Indian Ocean where it is believed to have gone down after veering off course.

On Jan 29 this year, the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation announced that the misfortune was an accident based on international aviation rules and that all 239 people on board were deemed to have lost their lives.
The search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be expanded by another 60,000 square kilometers (23,000 square miles) in the Indian Ocean if the jetliner is not found by May, officials said Thursday, affirming their commitment to not give up until it is located.

No trace has been found of the Boeing 777 aircraft, which disappeared in March last year carrying 239 passengers and crew in what has become one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history. Most of the passengers were Chinese.
The extended search for the jetliner, which is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean off Australia's west coast, could take up to a year, officials said at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss and Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantang pledged to double the current search area if necessary.
"Should the aircraft not be found within the current search area, ministers agreed to extend the search by an additional 60,000 square kilometers to bring the search area to 120,000 square kilometers and thereby cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis," they said in a joint statement.
The second phase of the search would cost an estimated A$50 million ($38.74 million) which would be borne by Malaysia and Australia, Liow said at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur.
The total search area including the extension "would cover 95 percent of the flight path", he said.
MH370 vanished from radar screens shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, bound for Beijing. Investigators believe it was flown thousands of miles off course before eventually crashing.

In the first phase, a total of 120 million Australian dollars ($93.6 million) was spent by the two countries, split equally, and Liow said the next phase is estimated to cost A$50 million ($39 million).
The lower cost is because the equipment has already been purchased.

Truss said the plane may have had enough fuel to reach Maldives but it would have been impossible for it to be in the reported area in daylight and not be seen by anyone. Also, the flight path to Maldives would be inconsistent with satellite and radar data. “It is not considered a likely possibility,” he said.
China’s transport minister Yang Chuantang said China may contribute vessels and other assets in the next search phase.
“We will marshal some physical assets including vessels to participate in the search,” he said. “We will not waver in our commitment to continue the search until we find the plane and resolve the mystery.”
Officials from Malaysia, Australia and China agreed Thursday that if missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 is not found this spring in the current designated search area off the western coast of Australia, the zone would be expanded to double in size, and the quest could continue for another year.

Authorities are using underwater vehicles equipped with sonar to search a zone of more than 23,000 square miles, an effort expected to be finished by late spring; the work is  about 60% complete.
The expanded search area would cover more than 46,000 square miles, about the size of Pennsylvania. This bigger area, in an arc sweeping from northeast to southwest, officials said, would “cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis.”
Searching in the expanded area, the officials said, would take up to a year because of the “adverse weather conditions in the upcoming winter months” of the Southern Hemisphere.
MH 370 vanished in March 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. No trace of the jetliner, which had 239 people aboard, has been found.
Malaysia’s Minister of Transport, Liow Tong Lai, met in Kuala Lumpur with Deputy Australian Prime Minister Warren Truss and China’s minster of transport, Yang Chuantang.
The majority of the passengers aboard the flight were Chinese.

Australian, Malaysian, and Chinese government officials announced at a press conference on Thursday that they will double the search zone for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 if the plane is not found by May. An additional 60,000 square miles will be added to search efforts in the Indian Ocean west of Australia. The upcoming winter season could make the extended search take up to a year, officials said.
The current search mission is expected to be completed by next month. The combined two areas would cover 95 percent of the plane’s flight path, authorities said, which made them confident the plane would be found and peace can finally be brought to the victims and their families. The expanded search would continue to be funded by Malaysia and Australia, though the exact costs were not shared.
In a joint statement, Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss, and Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantang said:
Should the aircraft not be found within the current search area, ministers agreed to extend the search by an additional 60,000 square kilometers to bring the search area to 120,000 square kilometers and thereby cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis.
With 239 people on board, the plane mysteriously disappeared off radar March 8, 2014, while flying from Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Investigators later determined the flight made a series of turns that caused it fly thousands of miles off course before crashing. Eight months of dramatic search efforts have been futile and no trace of the plane has been found.
Teams have been using sonar equipment and underwater drones to search 60,000 square miles roughly 1,000 miles off Australia’s west coast. So far, they’ve searched more than 60 percent of previously uncharted sections of the sea floor, according to Reuters. After months of no sign of the plane, international support has dwindled to a handful of ships. The ministers said they were “committed to the search,” but Reuters reported they appeared to suggest the new efforts would be the best and final opportunity to locate any of the plane’s debris. 
Investigators looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in the Indian Ocean may almost double the area they are combing if the current search doesn’t yield any results.
The search area may jump to 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) and the additional territory may take a year to comb, according to a statement issued by Malaysia, China and Australia. Ministers of the three countries met in Kuala Lumpur today to agree on the new course of action after 13 months of search so far yielded not one piece of debris.
The decision means the search for the plane will continue after the current search zone is fully analyzed around the end of May. Any solution to the longestsearch for a commercial jet in aviation history hinges on finding the black box flight recorders attached to the missing aircraft’s tail section, which may hold clues on what happened to the plane that dropped out of radars March 8, 2014, while on a routine commercial flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.
“In the current circumstances, all the evidence that you’re going to get is in those recorders,” Geoffrey Dell, an associate professor at Central Queensland University specializing in air accidents, said by phone. “It’s probable that they’re still readable and would be for some time more.”
A 584-page report released on the first anniversary of its disappearance March 8 last year contained no new evidence capable of explaining why the Boeing Co. 777-200ER disappeared with 239 people on board.
Search vessels have so far scanned an area of seafloor larger than the Netherlands in a remote region of the southern Indian Ocean about a third of the way from Australia to Madagascar.
The investigations focus on an area labeled the seventh arc, a line drawn over the ocean where satellite communications suggest the plane’s fuel ran out. Measurements of seven attempted data communications between the aircraft and an Inmarsat Plc satellite are the only clues to the direction of the aircraft after it disappeared from radar tracks over Andaman Sea west of Thailand.
Current search operations are being funded jointly by the Australian and Malaysian governments. Beijing has provided ships and personnel to assist the hunt, He Jianzhong, China’s Vice Minister for Transport, told a media conference last August.
Australia’s main search contract with Fugro NV, which is providing three of the ships scanning the seafloor, is worth A$39 million ($30 million) and lasts until August 2016, according to a summary of the public tender. Canberra set aside A$54 million for the search in the year ending June 30, according to its most recent budget papers.
On Jan. 29 Malaysia’s civil aviation department declared Flight 370 an accident and said all on board were presumed dead. That declaration was intended to help families obtain assistance including compensation.
All information received to date “supports the conclusion that MH370 ended its flight in the southern Indian Ocean,” Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director general of the department, said in a statement at the time.
“Ministers remain committed to bring closure and some peace to the families and loved ones of those on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370,” according to the communique.
The underwater search area for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 looks set to double in size.
Teams are scouring the depths of a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean for the remains of the passenger jet that disappeared more than a year ago with 239 people on board.
So far, they've covered about 60% of the priority search zone without reporting any trace of the airliner. Families of passengers and crew members still have no answers about what happened to their loved ones.
If the searchers haven't found anything by the time they've covered the entire 60,000-square-kilometer priority zone, the search will stretch into a new equally vast area, government officials from Malaysia, Australia and China announced Thursday.
"Ministers remain committed to bring closure and some peace to the families and loved ones of those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370," the three countries said in a joint statement.
Next phase could take another year
The search of the current priority zone is expected to be completed in May. Covering the new zone could take as long as a year.
At that point, "all high probability search areas would have been covered," the governments said Thursday.
The size of the doubled search area, the equivalent of more than 46,000 square miles, would be bigger than the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.
Flight 370 vanished after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing.
Officials are still trying to figure out why it veered dramatically off course over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam and where exactly it ended up.
An international team of experts used satellite data to calculate that the plane eventually went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far off the coast of Western Australia.
The people on board the Boeing 777 came from various nations, but the majority were Chinese.
The search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will be doubled if nothing is found in the current search zone, officials say.
The announcement came from Australian, Malaysian and Chinese ministers meeting to discuss progress.
The plane, flying from the Malaysian capital to Beijing, disappeared on 8 March 2014 with 239 people on board.
It is believed to have crashed off Western Australia, but so far no trace has been found.
At the moment teams using sophisticated sonar equipment are scouring a 60,000 sq km (23,000 sq mile) area of seabed far west of the Australian city of Perth. About 40% of this remains to be searched.
If nothing is found, the search will be extended by another 60,000 sq km to "cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis", a joint statement from the ministers said.
The additional search area could take up to a year to complete given adverse weather conditions in the upcoming winter months, the statement said.
Investigators still do not know what happened to the plane.
The search zone has been defined based on analysis of hourly "handshakes" between the plane and a communications satellite.
There is still no explanation as to why it flew so far off course - making finding the plane and its "black box" voice recorders key to understanding its fate.
"We are confident we are searching in the right area,'' Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss told journalists after the meeting.
"We are confident we have the best search equipment... if the plane is in the area we will find it.''
